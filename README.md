A Cultural Market Model (ACMM)
is a model that measures people's buying habits under social pressure and the market share of products. 
It was developed by Amaç Herdağdelen and Haluk Bingöl at Boğaziçi University in 2007.

I am working with Haluk Bingöl to create this model from scratch and measure how much people's connections with each other will affect the model.
