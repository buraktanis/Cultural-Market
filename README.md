This is a model that measures people's buying habits under social pressure and the market share of products. It was developed
by Amaç Herdağdelen and Prof Dr Osman Haluk Bingöl at Boğaziçi University in 2007. I am working with Prof. Dr. Osman Haluk
Bingöl to create this model from scratch and measure how much people's connections with each other will affect the model.
